# Sample Interview Questions

One of the best things about Udacity's iOS Developer Nanodegree was the amount of career coaching they offered people changing careers, just like me. Several stages of the program required answering sample interview questions for their board of reviewers, and I've included those interview questions and my responses here in case it might be helpful info for a company currently reviewing my resume. I'd like to make your decision to hire me even easier for you!
